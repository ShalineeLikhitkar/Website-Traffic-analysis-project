# 📊 Website-Traffic-analysis-project

This project focuses on analyzing website session data to uncover user behavior insights, session duration patterns, bounce rates, and conversion trends. The analysis was conducted using Python, Pandas,seaborn and Matplotlib within a Jupyter Notebook environment.


🧠 Objective
To understand how users interact with a website — session count, device type distribution, bounce behavior, and conversions — and extract valuable business insights for decision-making.


## 🛠️ Tools Used 

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

- 
##📁 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following key fields:

      📊 `Channel group`  
      📅 `DateHour`  
      👤 `Users`  
      🔄 `Session`  
      🤝 `Engaged Sessions`  
      ⏱️ `Average engagement time per session`  
      📈 `Engaged sessions per user`  
      🎯 `Events per session`  
      ✅ `Engagement rate`   
      🔢 `Event count`

##🛠️ How I Worked on This Project

  - Data Loading & Cleaning 
  
  - Loaded the dataset into a DataFrame. 
  
  - Checked for null values and handled missing data. 
  
  - Converted time-based columns to datetime for better analysis. 
  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
  
  - Analyzed session duration distribution. 
  
  - Grouped data by device type and calculated bounce/conversion rates. 
  
  - Plotted visual insights using bar plots and histograms. 
  
  - Insights & Summary. 


📈 Key Findings (Output)

  ✅ What patterns or trends can you observe in website sessions and users over time?
  
  ✅ Which marketing channel brought the highest number of users to the website, and how can we use this insight to improve traffic from other sources?
  
  ✅ Which channel has the highest average engagement time, and what does that tell us about user behavior and content effectiveness?
  
  ✅ How does engagement rate vary across different traffic channels?
  
  ✅ Which channels are driving more engaged sessions compared to non-engaged ones, and what strategies can improve engagement in underperforming channels?
  
  ✅  At what hours of the day does each channel drive the most traffic?
  
  ✅ Is there any correlation between high traffic (sessions) and high engagement rate over time
  


##📌 Conclusion:

This analysis helps understand website traffic behavior, improve conversion strategies, and optimize for device-specific performance. This can guide targeted marketing or UI/UX improvements.This analysis helped uncover how users interact with the website across different channel groups and time periods.
We found that engagement metrics like session count, event frequency, and conversion rates vary based on user behavior and device types.
These insights can guide marketing efforts, improve user experience, and support data-driven business decisions.
